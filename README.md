## Arduino Parking Assistant

This is a small project to help ensure that when you park your car in your garage, it is close to where you want it to be. 

This is similar to the hanging a ball by a string idea, except high-tech! How could you not want this? 

### parts

What you need:
* Arduino - preferably something small like an Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 5V/16MHz
* An Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - HC-SR04
* LED - RGB Clear Common Anode

optionally:
* a ProtoShield
* some male & female headers
* microB USB Breakout - for simply powering it
